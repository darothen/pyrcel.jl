# pyrcel.jl

This is a port of my Python-based cloud parcel model,
[pyrcel](https://github.com/darothen/pyrcel), to Julia. There's no particular
reason for doing this other than a learning exercise, and possibly to explore
scientific machine learning applications using the native toolchain that
Julia provides.
